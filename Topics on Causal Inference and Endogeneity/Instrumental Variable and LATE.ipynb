But since we are asking the effect of $x$ on $y$, and since $z$ impacts $y$ via $x$, we 'scale' the effect of $z$ on $y$ by the effect of $z$ on $x$, to get the effect of $x$ on $y$.\n",

Since both of them are dummy, it is possible to specify the relationship between $T$ and $Z$ as linear: this is good, since if we do so, $Z$ is actually an IV for $T$: it is correlated with $T$, but it is not directly tied to $y$ (app use)\n",

    "In the basic framework, the choice of $T$ facing $Z$ is not related any covariates. This is not realistic; in general, the heckman two-step framework is more reasonable. However, the above compliers- non compliers framework is helpful for us to understand the role of instrumental variables, and when can it be applied to treatment problems. Having said this, The lmber & Angrist (1994) non-compliance framework is useful in dealing with real-world projects: Campaign is randomly assigned, while users may choose to participate or not. we can try both IV methods or Heckman two-step (MLE) and compare their results. \n",
